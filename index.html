<p> I am a 25-year-old student journalist with strong interests in aviation, politics and history/science. </p>
<p> I find myself being drawn to photojournalism and hope to find an internship that allows me to focus on that. </p>
<p> These are my top 3 favorite journalism stories: </p>
<ol>
  <li> <a href="https://womenshistory.si.edu/blog/their-merit-first-american-women-fly-combat" target="_blank" >On Their Merit: The First American Women to Fly in Combat </a> I like this article because the images and hearing from the women and their accomplishments only inspire me more. It blends all of my interests together and I can only hope to achieve the same in terms of writing, photography skills, getting to meet amazing people, and be around aviation and space in any capacity. </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a32883923/ahmaud-arbery-death-running-and-racism/" target="_blank" >Twelve Minutes and a Life </a> This article envoked a lot of emotions in me when I first read it. I think splitting between the past and leading up to how Ahmaud Arbery died, was brilliantly done. </li> 
  <li> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/07/magazine/bad-bunny.html" target="_blank" >The World According to Bad Bunny </a> I loved that the reporter got to not only feel as if she were in Bad Bunny's circle, but she also sheds light on the issues and concerns in Puerto Rico. I also love that she gives a deeper insight into Bad Bunny and his experiences growing up, as well as consistently throwing in particular things that reminds me of my own family. </li>
